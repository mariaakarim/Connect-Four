## Game Description

This game is a python implementation of the popular board game
connect four. 

Connect four is a 2 player game, and the rules are very straight forward. You each take turns placing disks and whoever gets 4 disks either vertically, diagonally, or horizontally wins. Keep in mind that whenever a player places a disk, the disk is placed at the lowest possible row, and the disks stack on top of eachother.
