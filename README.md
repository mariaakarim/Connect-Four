### Game Description

This game is a python implementation of the popular board game
connect four. 

Connect four is a 2 player game, and the rules are very straight forward. You each take turns placing disks and whoever gets 4 disks either vertically, diagonally, or horizontally wins. Keep in mind that whenever a player places a disk, the disk is placed at the lowest possible row, and the disks stack on top of eachother.

### Game controls

When you start the game, click the play button to advance to the game screen. There are two players, so you each take turns placing one disk, player 1 is red, and player 2 is yellow. Place disks by clicking on the column you want to drop the disk in.
