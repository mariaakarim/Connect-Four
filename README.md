## Game Description

This game is a python implementation of the popular board game
connect four. 

Connect four is a 2 player game, and the rules are very straight forward. You each take turns placing disks and whoever gets 4 disks either vertically, diagonally, or horizontally wins. Keep in mind that whenever a player places a disk, the disk is placed at the lowest possible row, and the disks stack on top of eachother.

  ### Onimisi Ayira, github username: ayira-onimisi:
   * I implemented about 95% of `board_view.py` with the gameplay, I wasn't responsible for adding a check for a winning move. I also
    implemented about 50% the class `board.py`, all the methods apart from the `check_winner()` method and the functions that  `check_winner()` uses. I also created `colors.py`. In the readme I wrote the Installation guide, the Documentation page([the wiki page](https://github.com/AFYY/csc290-connectfour/wiki)), I added screenshots to the readme and I also selected the license used for our project.
